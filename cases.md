**Buy now, pay later? No, thank you!**  
Buy now, pay later options allow consumers to pay for their online purchases later. This can cause financial problems for consumers, and its use conflicts with notions of responsible consumption. This project identified the key beliefs that interventions should target to reduce consumers' use of buy now, pay later systems. In doing so, it contributes to the development of interventions aimed at keeping consumers financially healthy and promoting responsible consumption.

We examined the beliefs that drive students' intention to use a condom during a one-night stand to determine the key beliefs that interventions should target to promote this healthy behavior.
