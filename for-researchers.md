### Grant and research proposal collaboration
Are you planning to write a proposal that includes the development of a campaign or intervention, or do you need input to develop (stimulus) materials for campaign or intervention research or experiments? Please contact us to see if we can help you develop your proposal or design an appropriate work package to strengthen your proposal.

### Identifying message content to help design effective stimuli
Do you need stimuli (e.g., text, audio, video, scripts, protocols, or any other type of stimuli you want to use) for your research project that can influence intention or behavior (or its determinants attitude, social norms, or perceived behavioral control)? Perhaps you want to study the impact of different types of videos, such as informational or emotional videos, on the intention and behavior of your target audience. Well, to have a good test, you first need the right content. We can help you decide what your stimuli should "say" or "do" to increase your chances of success, and test the effect of your manipulation of interest under the most optimal conditions.
