### Grant and research proposal collaboration
Are you planning to write a proposal that includes the development of a campaign or intervention, or do you need input to develop (stimulus) materials for campaign or intervention research or experiments? Please contact us to see if we can help you develop your proposal or design an appropriate work package to strengthen your proposal.

### Identifying message content to help design effective stimuli
Do you need message-based stimuli for your research project that are capable of influencing intention or behavior (or its determinants)? Perhaps you want to investigate the impact of different types of messages, such as rational or emotional messages, on the intention and behavior of your target audience. Well, to have a good test, you first need the right content. We can help you decide what to focus on to increase your chances of success.
